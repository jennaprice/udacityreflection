When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    1) Collaboration
    2) Back up
    3) allows you to get to work quickly if a computer fails

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    1) especially if code is in production you may want the update yet
    2) if multiple people are working on it you wouldn't want them updated unitl they were ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks allow you to get a copy of someone's code and modify it while attributing but not changing the code.
    Clones allow you to download a copy of the code on the existing local computer.
    Branches allow you to test different sets of code before deciding what you want.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to know changes have been made to the origin.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without it you would have to pass different versions of files around, via email or file share.
    It would be easier for small programs than learning all the new commands. For collaborating with
    more people Github would definitely be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
